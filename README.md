# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project. The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19. So let’s start the task of Unemployment analysis
